# Hacktober Fest 2023 Weather App

Welcome to the Hacktober Fest 2023 Weather App project! This open-source project aims to create a weather application with a world map, allowing users to select a country from a dropdown menu and providing automatic IP detection to display the user's country and weather information. We invite you to contribute to this project as part of Hacktober Fest 2023, which begins on October 26th!

## Project Overview

This project's main goal is to create a user-friendly weather app with the following features:

- **World Map**: An interactive world map will be displayed, allowing users to explore weather information for different countries visually.

- **Country Selection**: Users can select a country from a dropdown menu to get detailed weather information for the chosen location.

- **Automatic IP Detection**: The app will automatically detect the user's IP address and display weather information for their current location.
